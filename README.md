# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System

The **Smart Traffic Management System** is an AI-powered solution that uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to monitor and optimize traffic flow in real-time. This project aims to detect, classify, and count vehicles, estimate traffic density, and dynamically manage signal timings to reduce congestion.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This system leverages YOLO-based object detection and machine learning to:
- Detect and classify vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, bikes)
- Analyze traffic flow in real-time using CCTV or video footage
- Predict congestion and manage traffic signal durations accordingly
- Provide traffic analytics and reports for urban planning

## 📌 Features

- 🚘 Real-time vehicle detection and classification using YOLOv5
- 🧠 Congestion prediction using ML models (Random Forest / XGBoost)
- 📈 Traffic density estimation and logging
- 🕒 Dynamic signal control based on traffic volume
- 🗺️ Dashboard for traffic statistics and visualization (Power BI or custom UI)
